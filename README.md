## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hey there! Iâ€™m **Eunijoy**, a curious and determined front-end developer on a journey to master **Shopify theme development**. While I'm early in my path, Iâ€™m diving headfirst into **Liquid logic**, **responsive design**, and **custom schemas** â€” eager to learn, build, and evolve with every line of code.

My hunger for growth drives me to explore best practices, troubleshoot challenges, and align designs closely with tools like **Figma**. Iâ€™m not afraid of deep work and believe that precision paired with creativity creates seamless user experiences.

Beyond the tech, Iâ€™m someone who finds joy in the simple things â€” like the comfort of cartoons that remind me of childhood. That sense of wonder fuels my approach to development: always striving for something functional and quietly delightful.

### ðŸ’¡ Current Focus
- Learning Liquid and Shopify theme architecture
- Building responsive layouts with CSS & HTML
- Turning Figma designs into engaging interfaces
- Debugging and problem-solving through experimentation

### ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Looking For
Collaborators who value curiosity, patience, and shared growth. If you're building something exciting and don't mind mentoring or learning together â€” Iâ€™m here for it.
